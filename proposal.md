Proposal: RPG Boss Fight - Igneous Intrusion

I will create a demo of an RPG-style boss fight, using Python to code a battle system. The demo will use sprite-based assets. 

Features: Battle system using Python's math functions, In-window GUI for visuals. 

Challenges: The UI will likely be the most difficult part for me to program. While I have a general idea on how I will program the combat system itself, 
I will need to learn more in regards to creating interactible buttons in a UI. I will also need to balance the battle in a way that requires strategy with 
use of inputs, rather than being too easy or too hard. 

Ideal Outcome: Fully playable RPG demo, featuring a boss fight which can be completed. 
Minimal Viable Outcome: I will make a functional UI and a battle system. Even if the fight is not perfectly balanced, I will still consider the project
a success if it is easy to complete. 

Milestones: 
11/11: Basic math functions of combat system in place. 
11/18: Combat system containing multiple options (Attack, Defend, Magic)
11/25: Functional UI allowing for user input
12/2: Refined UI containing all combat features
11/4: All assets complete
